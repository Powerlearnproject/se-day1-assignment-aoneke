#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods to develop and maintain high quality software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
First, establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s due to increased software complexity and an emerging demand for more robust software development solutions and principles. 
Secondly, the introduction of structured programming in the 1970s where software engineers shifted from 'spaghetti' code to clear, structured coding like looks and conditions to make it easier to debut, maintain and build on existing code. 
Third, the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000 which simply adopts and iterative approach to coding rather than rigid, long-term planning which is inefficient and costly.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of development must be completed before moving to the next. It follows a fixed sequence: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance. Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed. It follows a rigid and strict order, it is documentation-heavy, it has a fixed-scope and has predictable timelines. More predictable timelines and costs.
Agile methodologies is an iterative, flexible approach where development is broken into small, incremental cycles called "sprints". It allows for frequent feedback and adjustments throughout the process, emphasizing collaboration and adaptability. It is flexible, customer- or end-user focused, allows incremental delivery and encourages team collaboratio. Timelines and costs are less predictable due to its constantly-evolving nature.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOftware developer: Coding, developing solutions, debugging, version control, collaboration, version control.
Quality assurance engineer: Test planning, manual testing, automated testing, bug reporting, regression testing, perfomance testing
Project manager: Project planning, team coordination, stakeholder communication, risk management, monitoring progress, risk management, problem solving, quality control

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio and Eclipse provide important software development tools to ensure code-writing efficiency, debugging support, integrated tools, project management, and cross-platform development.
Version Control Systems (VCS) such as Github and Subversion enable programmers to track and manage changes made to code over a development period and allow collaboration, change tracking, backup and recovery, branching and merging, and continuous integration.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Dealing with complex codebases - such as spaghetti code. Potential solutions are refactoring, modular design and design patterns.
Dealing with changing requirements - such as scope creep. Potential solutions are using agile methodology, prioritization and clear documentation.
Debugging and troubleshooting - such as hard to find bugs. Potential solutions are automated testing, logging and monitoring, and rubber duck debugging.
Time management and tight deadlines. Potential solutions are using time estimation techniques and task management tools.
Technical debt such as use of shortcuts and suboptimal solutions. Potential solutions are code reviews and refactoring.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly in isolation. Important for catching errors early in development and ensuring code reliability.
Integration Testing: Tests how multiple units or components work together. Ensures that different parts of the system interact properly without causing unexpected behavior or bugs.
System Testing: Tests the entire application as a whole. Ensures the complete software system meets specified requirements and functions correctly in real-world scenarios.
Acceptance Testing: Validates the software against user requirements. Ensures that the product meets business needs and is ready for deployment to end users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting precise input prompts to guide AI models like GPT in generating accurate and relevant responses. It's crucial for improving model outputs by specifying context, instructions, or desired formats, enhancing the quality of AI-generated results and aligning them with user needs effectively.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Tell me about technology."
Improved prompt: "Explain how blockchain technology improves security in financial transactions."
The improved prompt is more effective because it's clear, specific, and concise. It narrows down the broad topic of technology to a particular field (blockchain) and focuses on a specific aspect (security in financial transactions). This helps the AI generate a more relevant and useful response.
